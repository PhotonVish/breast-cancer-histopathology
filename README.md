-> Developed a Deep Learning-based Histopathology Classifier using PyTorch and the ConvNeXt architecture to detect Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) with ~90% Accuracy and 0.95 AUC

-> Engineered a robust preprocessing pipeline using Elastic Transformations and Stochastic Depth regularization to handle high intra-class variance in medical imaging.

-> Optimized model performance using Transfer Learning and Test-Time Augmentation (TTA), reducing false positives while maintaining high sensitivity on an imbalanced dataset of 277k+ patches.
